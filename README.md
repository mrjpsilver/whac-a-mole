# Whac-a-Mole
This is a front-end skills assessment. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to build a [Whac-a-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole) game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aesthetics of the game will be taken into consideration, but they're low-priority compared to meeting the primary requirements and the quality, performance, and readability of your code.

Should you desire snazzy mole clipart, here's a [choice Google Image resultset](https://www.google.com/search?q=monty+mole&tbm=isch&source=lnt&tbs=ic:trans&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiq2-T0n_HdAhUjZN8KHYhOAB4QpwUIIA&biw=1527&bih=758&dpr=2).

### Technologies
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Please do not use any frameworks or libraries. Our primary focus is to see how you structured your code and solve basic functional paradigms, so use this as an opportunity to showcase your understanding of the core UI technologies. 

### Game Objective
Click a “mole” as it appears. The amount of time each mole stays visible should be random. The game should have a time limit. There should be controls available to start, stop, and reset the game. 

### Requirements:
- The game should function consistently in IE11+ and one other major browser
- The game should function consistently in at least 2 unique viewport sizes. 

### Secondary Considerations (not required):
- Code formatting, readability, and documentation
- Performance Optimizations
- Accessibility

### Distribution
Provide a GIT repository with your source code. If any build systems were used, please include instructions to run them in a Readme.
